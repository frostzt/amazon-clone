# lyfmoments

lyfmoments is an application which will be available both as a mobile and web application. The aim is to help people with mental problems and mental health issues. In today's world where enough care and attention is not given towards mental health lyfmoments can become a huge benefit.<br>
The gist of the idea is to help people by diversity and help them get rid of lonliness. Lonliness is one of the major aim of lyfmoments to be removed from inside of people. Not in way that if a person wants some 'me' time he or she can get it, but he must not think that there is nothing or no one in this world who cares for him/her.

## Getting Started

The project contains the client (frontend) and backend both with the env file for the environmental variables. The setup therefore is quite simple just clone the repo and do a `npm install` and it will install all the required dependencies. The scripts are provided in the `package.json` file!

### Prerequisites

Now incase you want to add something of your own or want to work on something that is already included you can simply run the npm commands to install or uninstall packages. Also there are few dev-dependencies that you might need. We recommend two of them to be install globally those are given below!

```
npm install concurrently --save-dev -g
npm install nodemon --save-dev -g
```

### Installing

To get up and running with the development environment just simply clone or download the latest version and then run `npm install`, if you don't want any thing to break use ` npm ci` instead.
The project has both backend and frontend created and seperated the backend is stored openly whereas the frontend is in the client folder.

Please run `npm install` in both client and in the project folder to get the server ready!
Then simply run `npm run dev` to start both the server and the client concurrently!
